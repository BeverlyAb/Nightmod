## Introduction

Nightmod is a tool for making live-moddable games. You can view a game's code while it's running and inject changes by simply hitting "Save". With the powerful Clojure programming language, you'll see your game come to life as you type. Please see [the website](https://nightmod.net) for more details. To get started, read [the tutorial](TUTORIAL.md).
